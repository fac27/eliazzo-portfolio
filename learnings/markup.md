## 1. Structure a site using semantic HTML to aid accessibility

We created a simple mock agency website with a focus on using concise semantic html that allowed users with varying accessibility to access and manouver the site. 

## 2. Ensure a web page is readable for screen readers

To ensure the web page is readable for screen readers, we ensured we were using the correct <h> elements with only one <h1> tag on the page. We included detailed alt tags so that users were informed of the img contents in instances where they could not see the img itself. We styled the page in order to meet the accessibility requirements (see 3).


## 3. Ensure our UI has sufficient colour contrast so that everyone can perceive it comfortably

## 4. Use various tools to check that our website meets accessibility criteria

We used the Chrome "Lighthouse" tab in the Developer Tools which can run different types of tests on a page, including "Accessibility". This informs you of obvious failures like low colour contrast or missing image alt text. A limitation of Lighthouse is that it cannot catch more complex problems, like a custom component that cannot be controlled with the keyboard. In order to overcome this we manually tested the page using a screen reader.

## 5. Use CSS media queries to ensure our content is always presented effectively on screens of different sizes

## 6. Demonstrate a mobile-first approach to building a website

## 7. Use CSS variables to apply repeated colours to HTML elements

## 8. Use CSS Flexbox to style children in a single-direction layout (ie a row or a column)

## 9. Use CSS Grid to style children in two-direction layout

## 10. Ensure our Git commit history tells a coherent story

## 11. Use the appropriate input types in HTML forms for gathering different types of information
